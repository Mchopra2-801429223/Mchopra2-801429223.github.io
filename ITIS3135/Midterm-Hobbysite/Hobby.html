        <h2>What do I need to start? and What should one have??</h2>
        <p>fret not my friend, we start from the basics.</p>
        <p>Here are some basic tools you should have in your kitchen:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Tool</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>

                <td>For chopping and slicing ingredients.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cutting Board</td>
                <td>A surface to chop on.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pots and Pans</td>
                <td>For cooking various dishes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Measuring Cups</td>
                <td>To measure ingredients accurately.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mixing Bowls</td>
                <td>For mixing ingredients.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Spatula</td>
                <td>For flipping and stirring.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>For mixing liquids and dry ingredients.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>These are just the basics, but as you get more into cooking, you can add more specialized tools to your collection.</p>
        <p>Don't worry if you don't have all of these tools right away; you can start with just a few and build your collection over time.</p>
        <p>Cooking is all about improvisation and using what you have!</p>
